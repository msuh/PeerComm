A simple working example of Peer-to-peer data communication using peer.js and a peer-server. The index.html is designed to connect to a localhost started with the sever.js file.

To run the server:
$node server.js

To run clients:
Open multiple index.html pages and try connecting using their IDs.



Todo:
1) Figure out how the sever can send messages to clients â†’ clients can recognize specific keyword to recognize new connections
2) Connect all clients viewing the same page
3) Once (1) works, design for how to dynamically connect all clients for all arbitrary pages that clients connect to. Dynamic meaning for every new Nipype workflow page clients create, keep track of the clients connected to each page (not for the entire server. Just for that specific URL).
4) Keep a hash table mapping {domainName}-->{list of connected peers}. It only takes one peer to request a connection for the pair to be connected. Thus, the new connected client can request a connection to the list of connected peers, so that the live peers do not have to do anything for each new connection. There is no necessary action required for disconnection since disconnections are automatically recognized by connected peers.

Process in achieving Todos:
1) Check in self.initializePeer() what id.domain returns in a hosted server. It currently returns null in a localhost, but may return the actual URL of webpage when hosted on a server. Host on openshift (node server only, don't need a db) and connect to it's server's ip (Figure out how to find the server ip address).
